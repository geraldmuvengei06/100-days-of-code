# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 16, 2023 (Example 1)
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Plan**: I'm gonna migrate my old portfolio from react to next js.

**Thoughts:** I need to up my react, next, redux and apollo game. I'm gonna work on my personal portfolio, focusing mainly on the technical details, not the design details.

I plan to post every step to dev.to as a tutorial.
